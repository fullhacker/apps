            <li>Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.</li>
            <li>To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click (or hover with the mouse and press Space).</li>

        <span class="hint">Hint:  If an open square has the correct number of marked neighboring bombs, use middle/wheel button to click on the open square to open all remaining unopened neighbor squares all at once. If an incorrect number of neighbors are marked, or all neighbors are marked or open, clicking the square has no effect. If an incorrect neighbor is marked, this will cause instant death.</span>
